Nove includes all official, book-published state and federal United States case law â€” every volume or case designated as an official report of decisions by a court within the United States.

Our scope includes all state courts, federal courts, and territorial courts for American Samoa, Dakota Territory, Guam, Native American Courts, Navajo Nation, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Our earliest case is from 1658, and we currently include all volumes published through 2020, with new data releases on a rolling basis at the beginning of each year.
