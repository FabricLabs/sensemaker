# Jeeves Tech Update (!!!)
End of the week dump after MVP+1WEEK â€” **tl;dr:** `feedback loop engaged`

## 1. NEW CLIENT PREVIEW URL: use [`jeeves.webhop.me`](https://jeeves.webhop.me/) to demo the pre-release before it deploys to `jeeves.dev`!  
  
  Recent infrastructure additions provide for direct access to our development servers.  Tap in to the bleeding edge of Jeeves' latest knowledge with this exclusive early-access program.
  **WARNING:** do not share this link with _anyone_.  **Keep it secret, keep it safe.**

## 2. **CHAT SERVICES** 
Jeeves now supports multiple messaging mediums, including Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp.  Let us know what platforms you prefer (and why) to help us shape the future of Jeeves.

Contact us to get Jeeves added to the platform of your choice, whether it be an existing group chat where you need a mutual arbiter, or to help organize evidence and arguments.

## 3. **DESIGN PHASE**
We've begun deploying the updated styles as provided by our designer, and will begin work on streamlining the UX of the MVP once it is deployed over the coming weeks.

Please give UX feedback, however sourced in the Core chat: https://matrix.to/#/room/#jeeves-core:fabric.pub
