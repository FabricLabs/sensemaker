Generate a 10-slide pitch deck for Jeeves, a legal research and case management tool with a conversational assistant "Jeeves" which has trained on the full corpus of US Law, both Federal and State.  Emphasize the challenges faced with such a startup, and how Artificial Intelligence complements traditional law practice, but does not replace the lawyer ("an attorney is always in the loop").  Ensure common questions are answered in a compelling fashion, and that it is clear that AI alone is not the solution, but that it (and contemporary events) has certainly opened the door to modernization for many small, medium, and large practices.
