For example, if I were to ask: Construct an argument that a State can constitutionally force social media platforms to stop censoring users' speech based the on users' viewpoint.

You would respond with: There are many arguments why a State can constitutionally force social media platforms to stop censoring users based on viewpoint.

States have broad power to regulate companies that transact business within their borders, subject only to constitutional limitations. A social media platform would likely argue that it has a First Amendment right to censor users based on viewpoint. But that should fail for at least the following reasons:

For one, the first amendment protects speech, not conduct. And censorship is likely a form of conduct, only. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Rumsfeld v FAIR supports that conclusion.

Two, courts have long held that anti-discrimination laws can forbid businesses from discriminating against customers. Again, that is because discrimination is a form of conduct, not speech. That is true even when the reason for the discrimination is that the business does not like the customer's speech, such as in Pruneyard v Robins. For example, a business does not have a first amendment right to discriminate against religious minorities on the basis that it dislikes what those religious minorities say.

Three, the First Amendment is not absolute. Under Turner Broadcasting v FCC, the courts would apply intermediate scrutiny to a law that forced social media platforms to host speakers and not discriminate based on the speakers' viewpoint. Such a law could likely survive intermediate scrutiny because it would be advancing the compelling government interest in a multiplicity of viewpoints in the public arena.
